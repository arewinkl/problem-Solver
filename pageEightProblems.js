// You forgot to count the number of toast you put into there, you don't know if you put exactly six pieces of toast into the toasters.
// Define a function that counts how many more (or less) pieces of toast you need in the toasters. Even though you need more or less, the number will still be positive, not negative.
// Examples:
// You must return the number of toast the you need to put in (or to take out). In case of 5 you can still put 1 toast in:
// six_toast(5) == 1
// And in case of 12 you need 6 toasts less (but not -6):
// six_toast(12) == 6

Problem: function sixToast(num) {
  console.log(num);
  return Math.abs(num - 6);
}
// Story
// YouTube had a like and a dislike button, which allowed users to express their opinions about particular content. It was set up in such a way that you cannot like and dislike a video at the same time. There are two other interesting rules to be noted about the interface: Pressing a button, which is already active, will undo your press. If you press the like button after pressing the dislike button, the like button overwrites the previous "Dislike" state. The same is true for the other way round.
// Task
// Create a function that takes in a list of button inputs and returns the final state.
// Examples
// likeOrDislike([Dislike]) => Dislike
// likeOrDislike([Like,Like]) => Nothing
// likeOrDislike([Dislike,Like]) => Like
// likeOrDislike([Like,Dislike,Dislike]) => Nothing
// Notes
// If no button is currently active, return Nothing.
// If the list is empty, return Nothing.
//?This solution works by setting res to whatever is being passed in, and if there is ever a situation where they match than you return 'nothing.

function likeOrDislike(buttons) {
  let res = "Nothing";
  for (let i = 0; i < buttons.length; i++) {
    if (buttons[i] === res) {
      res = "Nothing";
    } else {
      res = buttons[i];
      console.log(res);
    }
  }
  console.log(res);
  return res;

// Your function takes two arguments:
// current father's age (years)

function twiceAsOld(dadYearsOld, sonYearsOld) {
